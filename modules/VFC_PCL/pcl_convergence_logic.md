# PCL: Particle Convergence Layer — Core Logic Scaffold

**Halessa Fusion Model — Phase II: Vortex Field Compression Framework**

## Overview

The Particle Convergence Layer (PCL) initiates harmonic spin alignment across lattice shells, guiding high-density ionic influx toward field compression resonance via Vortex Field Compression (VFC) parameters.

The goal: **Localized harmonic stabilization of quasi-stable energy pockets** through field-locked rotation. This layer operates as the interstitial threshold between QESR Layer V and the core convergence bloom.

## Core Constructs

### 1. Λ_r (Lambda-r) — Harmonic Rotation Constraint

A scalar-tensor coupling modulating field containment pressure:

Λᵣ = ∂ψ/∂t + ω₀ · ∇φ(x, y, z)
Where:
- `ψ` = field phase potential
- `ω₀` = equilibrium angular frequency
- `φ(x,y,z)` = local convergence map function

---

### 2. ℘_s (Particle Shell Gradient)

Spin-aligned drift velocity influenced by harmonic lock:

℘ₛ = μ · (B × ∇ψ)
- `μ` = mobility factor (charge-mass ratio)
- `B` = magnetic torsion bias

---

### 3. ϕ_f (Field Curl Envelope)

Quasi-stable harmonic envelope guiding compression:
- `μ` = mobility factor (charge-mass ratio)
- `B` = magnetic torsion bias

---

### 3. ϕ_f (Field Curl Envelope)

Quasi-stable harmonic envelope guiding compression:

ϕ_f = ∇ × (Λᵣ · ℘ₛ)
This curl defines the final vortex field geometry and determines phase-lock onset.

## Phase Coupling Conditions

- **Tuned Ingress**: Only particles within Δω < ε may stabilize in the convergence bloom.
- **Boundary Folding**: Compression layer wraps recursively — forming a toroidal containment sheath.
- **Singularity Avoidance**: Drift-phase constraints avoid collapse beyond resonance barrier.

## Future Extensions

This scaffold will support:
- VFC_PCL field modulation maps (`.svg`)
- 3D parametric models (layered spin harmonics)
- LaTeX derivatives for publication-ready mathematics
