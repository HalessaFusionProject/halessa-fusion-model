QESR Validation Figure Suite

1. Lattice Modulation Depth Profile
￼
Function: \sin(x) \cdot e^{-0.1x}
Purpose: Depicts the dissipation of modulation intensity with radial progression — verifying coherent falloff.

2. Phase Sweep Transition Map
￼
Function: \sin(x) \cdot \cos(2x)
Purpose: Highlights the interference gradient through wave-coupled sweep domains — a snapshot of resonance chirality.

3. Peak Field Density
￼
Function: Gaussian centered on x=5

Purpose: Confirms stable density peak at convergence — resonance stack validation.

4. Log Decay H₃ Curve
￼
Function: \log(1 + (10 - x + 1))
Purpose: Represents asymptotic stabilization during field alignment — important for decay modeling.

5. Gradient Domain Topology
￼
Function: \tanh(x - 5)
Purpose: Describes polarity transitions — slope analysis at null-point symmetry for curvature modeling.
