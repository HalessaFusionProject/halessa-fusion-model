*Figure X.* *QESR Sweep Layers* — A stylized visualization of quantum entangled spin resonance (QESR) across five harmonized lattice states. This layered sweep forms the foundational architecture for coherence convergence during ionic compression modulation. The resonance pattern observed correlates to entanglement fidelity and temporal phase retention in simulated Nivalis Node dynamics.
