## Vortex Field Compression (VFC) — Phase I Overview

A recursive topology wherein convergent harmonic fields induce pressure folds within spin-aligned lattice geometries, allowing quasi-stable energy packets to compress into rotational equilibrium states.

VFC dynamics serve as a harmonic modulation substrate for QESR lattices and their particle convergence layer (PCL).

- Field induction: Coherent compression nodes via tri-harmonic gating  
- Stability constraint: Torsional lattice spin via entangled shell offsets  
- Governing condition: Internal resonance > phase-fold dissipation
